# Using a BeagleBone to monitor and control an aquarium

This project is dedicated to using a small Linux computer to read and react to inputs, control lighting, and provide a touchscreen based UI for tank information.

## Why?
Basically, I can. I have lots of available horsepower, so why not use it. My choice is to use a BeagleBone Black, connected to a touchscreen, and then attach all of the sensors and data gathering I can get at. For now, that will be limited to two temperature inputs, and a water level sensor. It will also control tank lighting for me, running a strip of WS2812B LED's effectively on a timer.
